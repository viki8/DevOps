1. Issues addressed in this build
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugs:
-----
   DISP-660 - Invalidation request does not clear "jcr:content" folder
   DISP-662 - Add filter rules to support We.Retail on publish

2. OpenSSL versions supported (Unix)
------------------------------------

   SSL enabled dispatcher versions (indicated by a '-ssl-' in the
   distribution package name) depend on the OpenSSL libraries
   installed on your target machine. All OpenSSL versions 1.0.x
   are supported, for more information see:

   http://www.adobe.com/go/docs_dispatcher_install_en


3. Installation (IIS)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Dispatcher 4.1.11 and later no longer supports Microsoft Internet
   Information Server (IIS) 5.x or 6.0: 7.0 or higher is required.

   Dispatcher no longer requires to be installed as an ISAPI filter. 
   Instead, it should be installed like a wildcard application on a
   site level.

   In IIS 7.x:

      1. Open IIS Manager and navigate to the site you want to manage.

      2. In Features View, on the site Home page, double-click Handler
         Mappings.

      3. On the Handler Mappings page, in the Actions pane, click Add
         Wildcard Script Map.

      4. In the Executable box, type the full path or browse to the
         disp_iis.dll that processes the request.

      5. In the Name box, type a friendly name for the handler
         mapping, e.g. CQ.

      6. Click OK.

      7. After you add a wildcard script map, you must add the
         executable to the ISAPI and CGI Restrictions list to enable
         it to run.

   In IIS 8.x and IIS 10:

      Follow the steps for IIS 7.x outlined above, then:

      1. Select your added handler, click "Edit Script Map".

      2. In the dialog, click on the button "Request Restrictions..."

      3. On the "Mapping" tab, clear the chechbox "Invoke handler
         only if request is mapped to:". This ensures that the
         handler is also invoked for non-existing files or folders.

      4. Click OK.


4. Additional installation steps (IIS) for SSL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   If you have a distribution package containing SSL support (indicated
   by a '-ssl-' in the package name), you'll need to install some
   additonal libraries:

   1. Navigate to the following location in your browser:

      https://www.openssl.org/community/binaries.html
      
   2. Follow links to download OpenSSL v1.0.1 or v1.0.2.

      Note that www.openssl.org no longer provides binary distributions. To
      obtain binaries you must either download them from a mirror site
      or download the source code and follow instructions to build it.

   3. When downloading from a mirror site, make sure it includes the dll files
      "ssleay32.dll" and "libeay32.dll".
      
   4. Extract the the OpenSSL binaries "ssleay32.dll" and
      "libeay32.dll" to the same location where you extracted the
      dispatcher binary "disp_iis.dll" to.
      

5. Additional installation steps (IBM HTTP Server) for SSL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   This information applies to IBM HTTP Server for the Windows
   platform.  If you have a distribution package containing SSL
   support (indicated by a '-ssl-' in the package name), you'll need 
   to install some additonal libraries:

   1. Navigate to the following location in your browser:

      https://www.openssl.org/community/binaries.html
      
   2. Follow links to download OpenSSL v1.0.1 or v1.0.2.

      Note that www.openssl.org no longer provides binaries distributions. To
      obtain binaries you must either download them from a mirror site
      or download the source code and follow instructions to build it.

   3. When downloading from a mirror site, make sure it includes the dll files
      "ssleay32.dll" and "libeay32.dll".
      
   4. Extract the the OpenSSL binaries "ssleay32.dll" and
      "libeay32.dll" to the folder <ihs_install>/bin (where
      <ihs_install> is IBM HTTP Server's installation folder).
      

6. Last release supporting Apache 2.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Dispatcher version 4.2.3 is the last version supporting Apache 2.2.

   Adobe will drop support for Apache 2.2 after December 2017, and
   recommends to upgrade to Apache 2.4.

   In case you stay with Apache 2.2 beyond December 2017, it is recommended
   to use a Linux distribution that commits to Apache 2.2 security updates.

   The last dispatcher release of 2017 for Apache 2.2 will still be
   available for download until end of 2018.


7. Mac OS X (Darwin) support
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Apache 2.4 Dispatcher module for Mac OS X is built against
   the out of the box distribution available in Mac OS 10.11
   (El Capitan). It will not work properly in Apache distributions
   installed by brew or built from source.


8. Online documentation
